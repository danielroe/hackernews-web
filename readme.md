## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lukeed/preact-starter
npm install
npm start
```

> :exclamation: **Pro Tip:** Use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to install dependencies 3x faster than NPM!
-->

## Development

### Commands

Any of the following commands can (and should :wink:) be run from the command line.

> If using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), all instances of `npm` can be replaced with `yarn`. :ok_hand:

#### build

```
$ npm run build
```

Compiles all files. Output is sent to the `dist` directory.

#### start

```
$ npm start
```

Runs your application (from the `dist` directory) in the browser.

#### stats

```
$ npm run stats
```

Compiles all files (in development) and displays a percentage breakdown of the bundle's code.

#### watch

```
$ npm run watch
```

Like [`start`](#start), but will auto-compile & auto-reload the server after any file changes within the `src` directory.
